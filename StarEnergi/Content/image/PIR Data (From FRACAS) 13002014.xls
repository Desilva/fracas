			<td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Current &quot;Work Rules&quot; for Scaffolding do not seem to reflect what is actually considered to be acceptable at MNL. This causes confusion when dealing with contractors. Examples include :- 
- The Work Rules states that wooden planks shall be used; however the Scaffolding Specification requires metal planks. 
- The current Work Rules state that they are intended to comply with the intent of the OSHA regulations but do not actually require compliance with the OSHA regulations. They just provide a few general requirements.
- Scaffolding tube requirements are not detailed. OHSA requires 48.3 OD and 4mm thick but this is difficult to get in Indonesia and it is unlikely that it is ever used.
- Frame type scaffolding is commonly used on site, but there are no requirements or even mention of its use in the ?Work Rules?.  It would seem that the equipment available in Indonesia does not comply with OSHA regulations as the tube is very thin.  Frame type scaffolding should also be used as a system and not mixed with other forms of scaffolding.
- Is the Inspector / Supervisor required to be Government Certified? Is the Supervisor who inspects and approves the scaffold also required to be a Certified Inspector? This is not clear.

Suggest updating the &quot;Work Rules&quot; for Scaffolding to match MNL?s requirements and requiring scaffolding to comply with an internationally accepted standard such as :?
